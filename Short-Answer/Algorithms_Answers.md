#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) the run time is O(n) due to the fact that it only have to run once and because the number of operations executed is unchanged but the input


b) the run time is O(n^2) due to the the nested loops and the total number of actions for each loop is dependent on n, when the # loops themselves reamins the same. 


c) the run time is O(n) due to the fact that the function is increasing at a same rate of 2 + bunnyEars(bunnies-1).


## Exercise II

since the egg gets broken when if it is thrown off floor f or higher, I would start at the middle and drop the egg  move upwards if it doesnt break and downwards if it does break.  Then I would find the middle for this new section and drop the egg and repeat until I find the "f" floor.  the runtime would be O(log(n)).
